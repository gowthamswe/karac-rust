## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Project Pivot: Sutra to Kāra.** The project has been completely re-envisioned. We have pivoted from the procedural "Sutra" language to "Kāra," a new language based on Role-Based Logic and the Kāraka framework. The `program...begin...end` syntax is deprecated in favor of an `Action: From: Into:` structure.

### Added
- Defined the new Kāra vision, architecture, and roadmap.
- Established "Self-Cleaning Arenas" as the target memory model.
